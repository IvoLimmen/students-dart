# Students

Just a simple application to see how to build something in Dart.

## Run

    dart run bin/main.dart

## Build

    dart compile bin/main.dart

This will output an application called main.exe. Run it with:

    ./bin/main.exe

When you type end it will show the averages per course per student.

# Evaluation

## The good:

    It is JavaScript/TypeScript like (Okish). 
    Object oriented.
    Extension methods.
    Elvis operator.
    Cascade notation (The old `using` in VB)

## The bad:

    None so far.

## The ugly:

    None so far.
